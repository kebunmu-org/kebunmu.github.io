## Why reforest in Indonesia?

Indonesia is one of the most biodiverse regions on the planet and home to about 23% of the world’s mangrove forests. However, in the last 50 years, Indonesia has lost over 40% of its mangrove forests. It is also consistently ranked in the top three countries for the highest rate of deforestation. The effects of deforestation have significantly impacted indigenous communities, who are often the first to feel the negative effects of climate change.


## How we started

In 2017, we began working to restore mangrove forests in Indonesia. By initiating meetings with local leaders, we identified planting sites and learned of the local community’s needs. The leaders on Biak Island had already realized an urgent need for forest restoration and had independently launched a small-scale mangrove reforestation effort. Recognizing our potential for large-scale restoration, they partnered with us to initiate mangrove reforestation projects. This paved the way for us to launch projects and hire local community members to start planting on Biak Island in West Papua. In 2023 we moved out from under the management of Eden Projects to foster a more locally-driven restoration initiative.
